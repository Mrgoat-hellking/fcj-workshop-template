# Online Shopping Website: Furious Five Fashion (FFF)
## E-commerce Website Solution with AWS and AI

### 1. Executive Summary
Furious Five Fashion (FFF) is an e-commerce platform focusing on the fashion sector, aiming to deliver the best online shopping experience for customers in Vietnam. The solution leverages AWS serverless services and AI technology to build a low-cost, scalable, secure online sales system that personalizes the shopping journey.

The website will provide product management, shopping cart, payment, order management, and customer support via an AI chatbot.

### 2. Problem Statement
### What’s the Problem?
Many clothing websites in Vietnam face problems such as slow loading speed, poor scalability, high operating costs, lack of personalization in the shopping experience, and no AI tools to assist customers.

### The Solution
The platform uses AWS IoT Core to receive MQTT data, AWS Lambda and API Gateway for processing, Amazon S3 for storage (including a data lake), and AWS Glue Crawlers with ETL tasks to extract, transform, and load data from the S3 data lake into another S3 bucket for analysis. AWS Amplify with Next.js provides the web interface, and Amazon Cognito ensures secure access. Similar to Thingsboard and CoreIoT, users can register new devices and manage connections, but this platform operates on a smaller scale and for internal use. Key features include a real-time dashboard, trend analysis, and low operating costs.

### Benefits and Return on Investment
- Reduce infrastructure costs by using AWS serverless.

- Optimize revenue with AI-driven product recommendations.

- Easily scale from MVP to production.

- Expected ROI within 6–12 months through increased online sales and reduced operating costs.

### 3. Solution Architecture
The e-commerce system is built on an AWS serverless architecture, leveraging cloud services to minimize operational costs and ensure scalability. The user interface is deployed with a modern frontend, while the backend is handled flexibly through API Gateway and Lambda. Data is securely managed with DynamoDB and S3. Security layers, authentication, and an AI chatbot are integrated to enhance customer experience and ensure system safety.
