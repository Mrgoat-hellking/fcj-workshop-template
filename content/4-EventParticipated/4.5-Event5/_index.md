## Highlights

### Part 1: The Future of AI Agents & AWS Vision

**The Future of AI Agents**
- Moving from experimental prototypes to production-ready solutions
- Enterprise adoption requires strong governance, security, and scalability
- Multi-agent orchestration and collaboration become the norm
- Cost optimization and resource efficiency are key challenges

### Part 2: AI Agent Models & Security

**Core Capabilities**
- Platform models: Claude, Titan, Llama with multi-modal support
- Security: data encryption, VPC endpoints, IAM policies, audit logging
- Challenges: Putting agents into production remains difficult

### Part 3: AWS Bedrock Agent Core
