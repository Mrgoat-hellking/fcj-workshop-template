### Week 4 Achievements:


* 1. Understanding AWS services for system deployment and migration

* Gained a solid understanding of the VM Import/Export process between on-premise and AWS environments.
* Learned how to use AWS Directory Service to deploy and manage Active Directory in AWS.
* Deployed WordPress on AWS Cloud architecture, including EC2, RDS, Auto Scaling, Load Balancer, and CloudFront.
* Understood the database schema conversion and data migration process using AWS DMS & SCT.
* Became familiar with Amazon WorkSpaces – a virtual desktop service for enterprise environments.

* 2. Capabilities Acquired

  * Configured Security Groups, Load Balancer, Auto Scaling Group.
  * Deployed WordPress on EC2 and connected it to RDS.
  * Integrated CloudFront CDN to improve performance.
  * Performed database backup and restoration.

* d. Database Migration (DMS & SCT):

  * Converted database schema using AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT).
  * Migrated data using AWS Database Migration Service (DMS).
  * Configured replication instances, endpoints, and migration tasks.
  * Monitored migration progress using CloudWatch Metrics.

* e. Amazon WorkSpaces:

  * Created and configured virtual desktop environments.
  * Managed users and access permissions.
  * Tested connectivity and performance of the workspace sessions.

* 4. Skills Gained

* Practiced a real-world migration process from on-premise to AWS Cloud.
* Mastered deployment of scalable web applications on AWS.
* Deepened understanding of Load Balancing, Auto Scaling, Directory Services, Migration, and WorkSpaces.
