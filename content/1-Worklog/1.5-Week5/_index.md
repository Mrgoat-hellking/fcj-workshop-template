### Week 5 Achievements:

1. Understanding and mastering core concepts

* Understood the concept of Serverless Computing and how AWS Lambda operates based on event-driven architecture.

* Mastered advanced monitoring services such as Amazon CloudWatch and Grafana for system performance tracking.

* Understood how to organize and classify resources using Tags and Resource Groups.

* Mastered Access Control with IAM Policies combined with Resource Tags to ensure the Least Privilege Principle.

* Learned centralized system management using AWS Systems Manager (Automation, Inventory, Compliance).

* Understood secure remote server access through Systems Manager Session Manager without the need for SSH keys.

* Mastered the concept and process of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) through AWS CloudFormation and AWS CDK.

* Distinguished between and applied CDK Essentials and CDK Advanced for infrastructure reuse and extensibility.

* Understood and applied Right-Sizing & Resource Optimization in EC2 to save costs and enhance performance.

2. Hands-on practice and configuration on AWS

* Created and configured Lambda functions to automate tasks such as log processing or data backup.

* Set up CloudWatch Dashboards, Metrics, Logs, and Alarms to monitor EC2, RDS, and Lambda performance.

* Connected Amazon Managed Grafana for visualizing CloudWatch data.

* Created and applied consistent Resource Tags to group resources by project, environment, and cost center.

* Configured IAM Policies with conditional tags for precise access control.

* Set up AWS Systems Manager to manage versions, execute Automation Documents, and verify Compliance.

* Used Session Manager to access EC2 instances without opening SSH ports, ensuring security.

* Deployed CloudFormation Templates (YAML/JSON) to automate infrastructure creation including EC2, S3, IAM Roles, and Security Groups.

* Developed and deployed infrastructure using AWS CDK (Python/TypeScript) with Constructs and Stacks for source organization.

* Completed CDK Workshop Series to create automated deployment pipelines for multiple environments (dev, test, prod).

* Used Compute Optimizer and Cost Explorer to identify optimal EC2 instance types and recommend right-sizing strategies.

3. Achieved results

* Mastered automation tools for managing and deploying AWS infrastructure (Lambda, CloudFormation, CDK).

* Learned to monitor, analyze, and optimize resources using CloudWatch, Grafana, and Systems Manager.

* Acquired advanced skills in remote access and system orchestration through Session Manager without SSH.

* Applied the Least Privilege Principle effectively in IAM policy design.

* Learned to optimize EC2 cost and performance based on real-time data analysis.

* Ready to deploy flexible, automated, and cost-efficient AWS infrastructure environments.

4. Integration and expansion

* Combined AWS Management Console with AWS CLI/CDK for parallel resource management.

* Developed the ability to analyze logs, create alerts, and automate responses using Lambda + CloudWatch Events.

* Ready to expand into DevOps pipelines (CodePipeline, CodeBuild) and multi-layer security (KMS, SCPs).
