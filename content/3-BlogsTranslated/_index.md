This section will list and introduce the blogs you have translated. For example:

###  [Blog 1 -Enabling customers to deliver production-ready AI agents at scale](3.1-Blog1/)
Nomalab leverages AWS services and generative AI to automate ad break detection in media workflows. Using Media2Cloud, Amazon Rekognition, Amazon Transcribe, Amazon Bedrock, and Amazon OpenSearch Service, the platform detects visual and audio cues, analyzes conversation flow, and generates contextual metadata for precise, frame-accurate ad placement. This automation achieves near-human accuracy, accelerates content processing from hours to entire libraries, scales cost-effectively, and enables media companies to optimize operations while maintaining high-quality viewer experiences.

###  [Blog 2 - Optimize Multimodal Search Using the TwelveLabs Embed API and Amazon OpenSearch Service](3.2-Blog2/)
This blog demonstrates how AWS enables organizations to implement multimodal video search and analysis at scale using a vector-based architecture. You will learn why combining TwelveLabs Embed API with Amazon OpenSearch Service is critical for extracting insights from video content, how this integration supports text-, image-, and audio-to-video search, and how AWS services such as OpenSearch, Secrets Manager, and supporting SDKs form a secure, scalable, and modular solution. The article also covers architecture design, indexing and search workflows, and real-world use cases showing how enterprises can efficiently manage, analyze, and retrieve information from large video libraries.

###  [Blog 3 - Optimizing Network Footprint in Serverless Applications](3.3-Blog3/)
WS helps developers optimize network footprint in serverless applications using data compression techniques. You will learn why compression is critical for transferring large payloads in services like AWS Lambda, API Gateway, SQS, and EventBridge, how it reduces latency and costs, and how AWS components such as Lambda, API Gateway, and S3 form a scalable and modular solution. The article also covers architecture patterns for handling large payloads, compression workflows, sample implementation in Lambda and API Gateway, and testing results demonstrating significant network footprint reduction while balancing compute overhead.
